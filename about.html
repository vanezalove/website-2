        <h2>About</h2>
        <h5>Developer<span>Digital Artist</span>Designer</h5>
        <p>
          A am a front-end web developer and polygonal digital Illustrator. I
          can create individual and personal images, projects and not an entire
          design. I am also responsible for creating art that conveys a specific
          message or idea. My artworks are typically present in books,
          magazines, websites and advertisements. If you're interested in
          pursuing an artistic career, learning what an illustrator's duties
          include may be useful for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Illustrators may produce individual pieces of vector art that can
          stand alone or can be added into another piece by a graphic
          designer.Vector artwork is art that's made up of vector graphics.
          These graphics are points, lines, curves and shapes that are based on
          mathematical formulas. When you scale a vector image file, it isn't
          low resolution and there's no loss of quality, so it can be sized to
          however large or small you need it to be. An illustrator is an artist
          who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by
          providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of
          the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to
          clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe
          textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in
          children's books. Illustration is the art of making images that work
          with something and add to it without needing direct attention and
          without distracting from what they illustrate. The other thing is the
          focus of the attention, and the illustration's role is to add
          personality and character without competing with that other thing.
          Illustrations have been used in advertisements, architectural
          rendering, greeting cards, posters, books, graphic novels,
          storyboards, business, technical communications, magazines, shirts,
          video games, tutorials, and newspapers. A cartoon illustration can add
          humor to stories or essays. >
